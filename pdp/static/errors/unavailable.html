	We have a lot of pieces in our system that help to serve up our large-scale climate data, but one or more of them are unavailable. Either our high performance database or our massive array of hard drives are taking a break for the moment. We <em>try</em> to stay up 24/7, but unfortunately it's not always possible. We're sorry that our down time has overlapped with your up time.

	Our system administrators are undoubtedly aware of and on top of this problem. Your best bet to check back in a few minutes to an hour. However, if the problem persists, you are more than welcome to <a href="mailto:climate@uvic.ca">shoot us an e-mail</a> and let us know what's happening. We'll be happy to give you a status update.
