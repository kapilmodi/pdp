Documentation for the PCIC Data Portal
======================================

User Documentation
-------------------

The main goal of the PCIC Data Portal boils down to one simple idea: *give users data*. The Data Portal attempts to provide a flexible system to give you the climate data that you need and *only* the climate data that you need. Spatiotemporal climate data can be extremely bulky and expensive to store, so we have created a system that doesn't waste resources by giving users more information than that in which they are interested. Selecting only one's data of interest is a foundational idea of the system.

Developer Documentation
-----------------------

The developer documentation is intended for the few software developers who are contributing code to the PCIC Data Portal. Much of it is auto-generated from the module and function docstrings. It is intended to be a low-maintenance reference, but use at your own risk.
